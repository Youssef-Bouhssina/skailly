- Gain hands-on experience with API integration

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building a component-based, dynamic user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, utility-first styling and responsive design
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For retrieving current weather and forecast data
- **Vite**: For project initialization and development environment
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project management

## Features

- 🌍 Global weather data for cities worldwide
- 🌡️ Current weather conditions display
- 📅 5-day/3-hour weather forecast
- 🔍 City search functionality
